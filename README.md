SI IT homepage
This is the homepage of SI/IT. SI/IT provides highly skilled developers from all over Europe, remotely or onsite. On this website the visitor can information about the company, its services and contact details.  

UX
This websites turns to stakeholders such as clients and employees
-As a user (partner/client), I want to find information about the company and its services.
-As a user (partner/client), I want to easy navigate and find contact details of the employees.
-As a user (employee), I want to refer to this page as my workplace to different stakeholders such as potential clients/employees.
-As a user (potential employees) I want to find out about open positions and contact details.   

Features
The website contains four sections – ”about”, ”services”, ”team” and ”contact”. The section ”about”, ”services” and contact is used to provide information only and in the section ”team” the user can send a message through a form.  In the footer the user can reach our linkedin page in a new browser.

*Existing Features
Feature 1 - Allows a user to send a message through a form.

*Features Left to Implement
This is features I would like to add in the future to make the page more useful:  
When clicking on the pictures information about the person will be shown.
Making the email clickable and enabling an email to open.
The form has no connection to a server. The form may be changed to enable uploading a CV instead of a message, when e-mail enables.  
We will add more colleagues in the team section
Making the services clickable and show cases.
 
Technologies Used

Testing
Buttons in the heading work correct – About, Services, Team and Contact.
Buttons ”MORE” and ”OUR SERVICES” is tested and works fine. When clicking on ”MORE” an orange frame shows up that dont want to disappear.    
The form on the team section is tested. When clicking on the send button an error in appearing that tells the user to fill the fields. The form has no function and is not activated. However if a correct format email does not exist the form will not give an error.
The page goal to provide users information and contact detail is achieved.
Tested on all devices and sizes. When the third picture (Caroline) is placed to the left and not centered.  
The Linkedin icon in the Footer opens in a new browser correctly but links to my page since the SI/IT does not exist.

Deployment

Content
The content is written by me to give the users relevant information about the company.

Media
The icons in this template were preinstalled from ”Font Awesome”. I have changed icons to adapt the content and used other icons from ”Font Awesome”. The photos are from my personal library and the main photo from the heading is a free downloaded picture from istockphoto.com.  

Acknowledgements
This is a free template downloaded from https://startbootstrap.com/themes/creative/.
Creative is a one page Bootstrap theme for creatives, small businesses, and other multipurpose use. A modern, flat design style works in unison with rich features and plugins making this theme a great boilerplate.
I have made color adaptations to fit the color palette of SI/IT. Main colors are black, white, grey and blue. Icon adaptations and all pictures are changed. All the text is changed.
In the custom made CSS file called ”custom.css” the changes are specified and override the premade css file.
